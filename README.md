# GooglePlayStore-EDA-Project
In this project i have used the dataset of kaggle of google play store and performed EDA and gain insights from the data. I used the Python functions ,pandas, matplotlib, seaborn library to transform the data and making the graphs for the EDA. Insights from the data are in the same notebook where i performed the Exploratory Data Analysis.
